A template is very easy to make. Assuming you know how to use the tags in Orion already.Tags in Orion are denoted by the '[[' and are closed by ']]'So lets say I want to use the TargetName from the ISIS3 cube file. Well, all I need to do is type my caption and use the TargetName value in the tag format.
Ex:
Template (.tpl): `This image of [[TargetName]] was taken by the [[InstrumentName]] orbitor.` 
 
Caption Output: `This image of Mars was taken by the MRO orbiter.`
