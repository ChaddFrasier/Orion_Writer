# Orion_Writer
==============================================================================
### Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The ISIS3 software is a binary data analysis tool for reading NASAâ€™s data files that were generated by Deep Space Imagers. We are Team Orion, and we have been given the task of tackling the Planetary Image Caption Writer Project sponsored by USGS. 

  **Using the current ISIS3 software, we will be creating a much easier way of cropping and adding important icons, like a scale bar or a north arrow, to the images as well as allowing users of the application to edit captions using extracted data from cube files.**

### Technology
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Third Party Modules Used
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Express
- Jimp
- EJS
- Path
- child_process
- express-fileupload
- fs
- i
- cookie-parser
- bluebird

We switched to Node.js because it provides better image processing than flask was capable of as well as performance boosts in the ISIS3 processing speed.
